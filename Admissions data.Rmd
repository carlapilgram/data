## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
head(UCBAdmissions)
colnames(UCBAdmissions)
rownames(UCBAdmissions)
UCB_df <- as.data.frame(UCBAdmissions)


library(dplyr)
UCB_df %>%
  filter(Gender == "Female", Dept == "B", Admit == "Rejected")
# Load necessary library
library(dplyr)

# Define the function
transform_ucb_data <- function(data) {
  # Convert table to data frame
  data_df <- as.data.frame(data)
  
  # Group by department and gender, summarize admissions
  data_df %>%
    group_by(Dept, Gender) %>%
    summarise(Total_Admissions = sum(Freq[Admit == "Admitted"]))
}

# Use the function on UCBAdmissions
data("UCBAdmissions")
transform_ucb_data(UCBAdmissions)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
